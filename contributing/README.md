# The Goal

* The goal of developing these notes is to create a handbook for some important topics that a software developer needs to know and understand. These notes are not comprehensive but are the first step to a 1000 mile journey.
* For the guides, please pick a topic, open an issue or reach out on twitter [@chiragbhatia94](https://twitter.com/chiragbhatia94) to get the go-ahead and start contributing.
* For the resources, we are still preparing the contribution guidelines but submit them in an issue for now. Just note that the resources are *highly opinionated* and *curated*. Your opinion on value of any resource may not match the opinion of curator.

## Guidelines

* ***Adding everything available out there is not the goal!**
  The notes represent the starting point to learn the skill-set most valuable today i.e. if you were to enter any of the listed fields today, what would you learn!
  Since its a handbook of curated notes for technical subjects, providing references to our source of study & links to advance tutorials is must, as it helps the user to study further as that is out of the scope for our small handbook.
* **Do not add things you have not evaluated personally!**
  Use your critical thinking to filter out non-essential stuff. Give honest arguments for why the resource should be included. Have you read this book? Can you give a short article?
* **One item per Pull Request**
  There may be a discussion related to an item you want to add. Adding just a single item per pull request makes it much easier for everyone involved.
* Write meaningful commit messages using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).
* Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones
